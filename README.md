# Prediction-Analysis-of-Medical-Cost-and-Annual-IncomeThis comprises of two sets of prediction analysis. 
The first has to do with the prediction of medical insurance costs, while the second has to do with the prediction of annual incomes based on census data. 
Both CSV files used in this analysis have been included here. Data exploration was carried out both datasets, prediction analysis was carried out and the 
models were finally optimised and validated. The predictors used to include Age, Sex, BMI, Number of Children, Smoker status, Region and Medical Cost. 
Multivariate regression models were built using the predictors and these were evaluated.
US Census data gotten from the Census bureau (publicly available from UCI Machine Learning Repository) was used to predict whether a given adult 
makes more than $50,000 a year or not based on a few attributes. Fourteen predictors were used such as age, employment status of and final weight, 
highest educational level, marital-status, occupation, relationships, sex, capital-gain, capital-loss, hours-per-week, native-country of origin and income. 
Machine Learning model was built using the following steps: Load and explore the data. Data cleaning used to handle categorical data. 
Training of Machine Learning prediction models such as classification models, Clustering and Neural Networks. 
These were aimed at predicting whether clients earned more than $50,000 or not. The model parameters were optimised and evaluated to improve their performance.
